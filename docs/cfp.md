HTRC is pleased to announce a call for applications to participate in our TORCHLITE Hackathon, taking place May 21-23, 2024 at the I Hotel and Conference Center in Champaign, Illinois. *Those selected to participate will receive up to $1000 in travel and accommodation reimbursement.*

The TORCHLITE project leverages HTRC’s new Extracted Features API. The Extracted Features API allows programmatic access to metadata and annotated token data (aggregated at the page level) for more than 17 million volumes from the HathiTrust Digital Library collection, including in‑copyright material. This robust dataset includes all kinds of useful metadata and data about individual books, which can be leveraged to create interesting visualizations and applications. HTRC is currently developing visualizations that map author location data, publication dates, and word frequency.

We’re looking for both programmers and subject matter experts in the humanities, social sciences, and other disciplines who are interested in developing new data visualizations, Jupyter notebooks, applications, and other creative applications of the Extracted Features API!

Those interested in participating can apply by completing this form by **March 1st**: <https://forms.gle/XgVj4nUsBWYnQmqEA>

Applicants will be notified of their selection by March 15th. Any questions regarding the Hackathon logistics or about applying can be directed to [htrc-help@hathitrust.org](mailto:htrc-help@hathitrust.org).
