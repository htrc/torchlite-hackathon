# Code of Conduct
This code of conduct is intended to encourage positive interactions between Hackathon participants and protect against harassment and abusive behavior. 

## Standards of Conduct
### Do’s
We encourage everyone to:
- Be kind and treat each other as professionals
- Engage in dialogue thoughtfully and with curiosity
- Be open to listening to alternative viewpoints
- Be generous and helpful with your own expertise and respectful of others’ expertise
- Approach interactions with empathy, patience, understanding and a sense of humor

### Respect the Opinions and Abilities of Others

The TORCHLITE Hackathon includes participants with different skill levels and approaches. As a result, we do not expect that everybody will share the same opinion. However, we do expect that disagreement is done respectfully. Additionally, we expect that participants will educate others respectfully. To this end, do not assume anybody else’s level of expertise or knowledge. Do not belittle a lack of information, or insist on unnecessary precision. We are all learning, so afford others—as well as yourself—room to grow.

### Keep Your Team Open
Except for instances where it would significantly impede productivity, there is always room on a Hackathon project for one more person. Unless doing so would be counter-productive to the goals of the project, anybody who is interested in a project is allowed to join it.

### Don’ts
Don’t Harass. Harassment is any unwelcome or hostile behavior towards another person for any reason. This includes, but is not limited to, offensive verbal comments related to personal characteristics or choices, sexual images or comments, deliberate intimidation, bullying, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of discussion or events, nonconsensual publication of private comments, inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual attention. Conduct need not be intentional to be harassment.
HTRC will not tolerate harassment of—or by— participants of the Hackathon in any form. Participants violating these rules may be expelled from the event at the discretion of HTRC staff.

## Resolving problems
When it is safe to do so, authentic engagement (aligned particularly with the Do’s outlined above) may resolve unwelcomed behavior and misunderstandings. When approached about one’s own behavior, participants are expected to listen carefully to any concerns, and to respond thoughtfully, and with empathy.

If it is not safe to address a problematic interaction directly, HTRC will address Code of Conduct violations as outlined in the next section. 
## Reporting issues
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an HTRC staff member. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. HTRC staff members will assist affected individuals in contacting hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe to the extent possible.

When making a report, the following information is useful, but not required:
- Who violated the Code of Conduct?
- Where and when did the violation occur?
- What happened?
- Who may have witnessed the violation?
- Who are you?

HTRC will determine what further action may be necessary, including potentially expelling an individual from the event. A follow-up communication will be made to individuals who report being harassed.
